I am a final-year master's student (top 5%) in Traffic Information Engineering and Control at the School of Electronic Information Engineering (Project 985), Beihang University, China, with expected graduation in January 2025. I am an optimistic, proactive individual with strong stress resilience and a keen sense of teamwork. My passion lies in machine learning, and my postgraduate research has focused on spatiotemporal series prediction and the integration of deep learning with transportation systems. I am currently applying for PhD programs, with a strong interest in generative AI and large language models. I would be happy to connect with you!
